Aircraft Battle (FPGA Game) Done by Yimin Chu and Zhongyi Wang

Aircraft Battle is a two-player co-op survival game built entirely in Verilog and deployed on the DE1-SoC FPGA development board. The game uses a VGA adapter for pixel rendering and a PS/2 keyboard for user input, creating a classic arcade feel with real hardware logic.

üéÆ Gameplay

Two Players:

Player 1 controls their ship with WASD.

Player 2 controls with IJKL.

Objective: Survive while AI-controlled ‚Äúchaser‚Äù ships pursue the players.

Win Condition: Stay alive until the progress bar fills.
